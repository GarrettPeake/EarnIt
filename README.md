# EarnIt
Do things to earn yourself the right to spend your own money!

1) Buying things is nice but you don't want to spend all of your cash

2) Making yourself do things sucks sometimes but we need to get things done

EarnIt combines these factors by having users perform tasks to earn points which can then be used to purchase things the user wants as a reward!

This was created because my old system was to set large goals along with large rewards such as finishing an entire course to allow myself to buy a drone, but I figure granularizing will make it easier to achieve goals while also reinforcing each step.
