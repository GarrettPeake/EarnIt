# EarnIt
Do things to earn yourself the right to spend your own money!

1) Buying things is nice but don't want to do it too much

2) Making yourself do things is sometimes not fun but we don't want to do it too little

EarnIt combines these factors by having users perform tasks to earn points which can then be used to purchase things the user wants as a reward!

This was created because my old system was to set large goals along with large rewards such as finishing an entire course, but I figure granularizing will make it easier to achieve goals while also rewarding each step.
